Doctors cure, engineers design, and bankers manage our money; each job holds a specific position in society. The aspect of teaching, however, stands out. Teachers play an important and meaningful role in society. They are a foundational element of a healthy, forward-thinking society. Apart from parents, they are the primary source of knowledge and ethics for children, carrying the responsibility and moral duty of education.

One needs to have a charismatic personality, patience, in-depth subject matter knowledge and exceptional communication skills in order to become a teacher - be it in preschool or in college.

## Types of Teachers <br>

Based on the level that you want to teach at, you will need a different outlook and set of skills and it is best to determine that before you start on your journey to any career. Here’s taking a look at the various levels:

 ## Pre-Primary School Teacher <br>
A preprimary teacher is the second most important person in a student's life, right after their parents. They supervise and teach students in the age group of 3 to 5. In addition to teaching the very basics of the alphabet, these are the teachers who lay the basic framework for social interaction and the personality that the child will develop at they grow up.

## Primary School Teacher <br>
Teachers in primary school work with students of classes 1 to 5, ranging from 6 to 12 years. It is the responsibility of primary school teachers to nurture life skills as well as basic age-appropriate educational concepts in the children. They build lasting impressions that will stay with the child for the rest of their lives.

## Secondary School Teacher <br>
Graduates who work as secondary school teachers teach students from grades 6 through 10. Secondary school teachers are in charge of gaining a thorough understanding of their students' lives and helping them pursue, in addition to their studies, their hobbies and aspirations. They encourage students to identify their individual interests and talents.

## Senior Secondary School Teacher <br>
Post-graduates with in-depth knowledge of a variety of specialised disciplines become senior secondary school teachers. These teachers provide in-depth explanations of the subjects being taught in school and provide basic guidance to students in choosing careers.

## Special Educator <br>
Teachers who work with students who have special needs—such as those who may be on the autism spectrum, or who have learning disabilities—are known as special educators. These educators are specially trained to understand the best course of action to be taken in dealing with children with special needs.

## Lecturer/Professor <br>
Teachers in college are usually designated as Assistant Professors, Associate Professors, or Professors or Lecturers. Teaching in college is very different from teaching in a school. The students come to college to specialise, so the instructor must have in-depth knowledge. College students are also a lot older and share a different dynamic with their teachers.

## Eligibility to become a Teacher <br>
